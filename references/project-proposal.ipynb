    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 30 years, the dating approach has changed and has become increasingly difficult. The willingness to date has decreased, dating is too expensive and time consuming, we have too many (perceived) options to date someone and we struggle because of accepting too easily negative sex stereotypes. In the 19th century, a custom in the United States called New Year’s Calling, was that on New Year's Day many young, single women would hold an Open House (a party or reception during which a person's home is open to visitors) on 1 January where they would invite eligible bachelors, both friends and strangers, to stop by for a brief (no more than 10–15-minute) visit. This custom was established with the term SpeedDating as a registered trademark by Aish HaTorah, who began hosting SpeedDating events in 1998. \n",
    "\n",
    "10 years later, Fisman et al. conducted a survey regarding speed dating habits and collected 8,000 observations during his 2 – year observation in his paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment. Because speed dating has become more and more interesting in the last few years and also through Corona a completely new dating approach has emerged, we want to discuss contexts in speed dating. With the data from this survey, we want to answer the following research questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   What are the most effective characteristics to achieve a match in opposite sex speed dating?\n",
    "-   What type of persons have the best chances to achieve a match regarding their characteristics? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our research question, we defined the following sub-questions to strengthen our main research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Do specific characteristics affect the match selection of the survey participants?\n",
    "-   Do these specific characteristics occur in both sexes?\n",
    "-   What type of persons participate in speed dating events?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following hypotheses support our research question:\n",
    "Null hypothesis: \n",
    "-   There is no affection of having specific characteristics regarding match selection of the survey participants\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "-   Survey participants who both have the specific characteristics samerace and opposite gender tend to achieve more matches\n",
    "-   Survey participants with a higher income tend to achieve more matches than survey participants with a lower income\n",
    "-   Achieving matches because of having the same specific characteristics occur in both sexes\n"
