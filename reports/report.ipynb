    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 30 years, the dating approach has changed and has become increasingly difficult. The willingness to date has decreased, dating is too expensive and time consuming, we have too many (perceived) options to date someone and we struggle because of accepting too easily negative sex stereotypes. In the 19th century, a custom in the United States called New Year’s Calling, was that on New Year's Day many young, single women would hold an Open House (a party or reception during which a person's home is open to visitors) on 1 January where they would invite eligible bachelors, both friends and strangers, to stop by for a brief (no more than 10–15-minute) visit. This custom was established with the term SpeedDating as a registered trademark by Aish HaTorah, who began hosting SpeedDating events in 1998. \n",
    "\n",
    "10 years later, Fisman et al. conducted a survey regarding speed dating habits and collected 8,000 observations during his 2 – year observation in his paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence from a Speed Dating Experiment. Because speed dating has become more and more interesting in the last few years and also through Corona a completely new dating approach has emerged, we wanted to analyse this dataset with the following questions in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are the most effective characteristics to achieve a match in opposite sex speed dating?**,\n",
